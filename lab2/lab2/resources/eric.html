<p style="text-align: left;" width="300">I recently read The True Believer by Eric Hoffer. It’s a book about how mass movements evolve. With a lot <br>
of historical examples, the book explains the patterns and common threads among them. It’s an insightful <br>
book and reading it was a great learning experience for me.<br>

<p><img align="left" src="" alt="The True Believer book cover" width="100px" height="90px"> What I’d like to share with you here is not the content of the book, though. Instead, I’d <br>
like to share with you about the author.</p>
<p>
You see, I didn’t know about Eric Hoffer before. But I imagined he must be a famous </br>
professor from a well-known university. I mean, what else could explain the depth of his </br>
insights? The True Believer is an influential book. Here is how <a href="">Wikipedia</a></a> put it... <a href="">read </br> more</a></p></td>
